## Summary

We can definitively conclude that males are more likely to use the bike share than females. Also, the early hours of the morning would be a favorable time to repair bikes. Unfortunately, no data was given for the city of Des Moines, so it is not possible to scale these results to see what the ridership would look like there.

### Future visualizations
Two more visualizations that could be ascertained from the data we do have:
1. Start/stop locations, by volume, for each gender and age group
2. User type by age group
