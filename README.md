## Summary

We can definitively conclude that males are more likely to use the bike share than females. Also, morings and evenings tend to be a bit busier, usually at rush hours. Unfortunately, no data was given for the city of Des Moines, so it is not possible to scale these results to see what the ridership would look like there.

### Future analysis
Two more visualizations that could be ascertained from the data we do have:
1. Start/stop locations, by volume, for each gender and age group
2. User type by age group
